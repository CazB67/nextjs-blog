At the school my children are at they have been using a program called *The Resilience Project* which focuses on developing the skills of Gratitude, Empathy and Mindfulness to build resilience. Having recently being made redundant, it's an opportune time to consider the positives of this and to be grateful for:

- **Time** to attend my children's school events, time to breathe, time to relax, time to learn new things, time to exercise, time to be.
- **New Opportunities** lie waiting in my future. Opportunities to develop my skills, meet new people and see how other business operate
- **Experience Project Completion** I wasn't happy at my old job for a long time. I like having an end goal and I feel like I never did. I mean I had tasks to complete and they were explicit but I never knew if my work was going to be kept or updated with the latest 'great' idea. I hope for a new job where I can see a new project to its end.
