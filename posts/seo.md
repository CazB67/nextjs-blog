title: 'SEO on Squarespace'

So I've been working on a good friend's Squarespace website [TracyRobinsonCreate](https://tracyrobinsoncreate.com.au/). She is a talented artist based in Fremantle, Western Australia. He art is primarily modern floral art using bright bold colours and native Australian flowers. The paintings are gorgeous. I have a couple. 

Having recently being made redundant, I have a bit of time on my hands and have been working on improving the website's SEO and improving the mobile responsiveness of the site. SEO is a big rabbit hole to go down and I wonder if everyone following all the best practice strategies will diminish the effectiveness oof all the recommendations given by various website audits. Food for thought!
